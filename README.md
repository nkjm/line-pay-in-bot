LINE_PAY_CHANNEL_SECRET=YOUR_VALUE
LINE_PAY_CONFIRM_URL=YOUR_VALUE
```

As for LINE_PAY_CONFIRM_URL, it will be https://YOUR_HOSTNAME/pay/confirm.

You can use free services like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) or [serveo](https://serveo.net) to launch your server.
Please be noted that you need to register your global ip address as white list of LINE Pay sandbox. Also need to register https://YOUR_HOSTNAME/webhook as webook URL in LINE Messaging API channel configuration.

### Launch server

If you like to try the server with middleware of the SDK, run follwoing command. This is much simpler but not so flexible.

```
$ node with_middleware.js
```

If you like to try the server without using middleware of the SDK, run following command. You can control the behavior more in detail in this configuration.

```
$ node without_middleware.js
```
